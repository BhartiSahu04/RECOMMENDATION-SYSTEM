# RECOMMENDATION-SYSTEM

A Recommendation System is an artificial intelligence (AI)-based system designed to suggest relevant items, products, or content to users based on their preferences, behavior, and historical interactions. It is widely used in various domains, such as e-commerce, streaming services, and online learning platforms.

# Types of Recommendation Systems

Content-Based Filtering:

Recommends items similar to those a user has liked before.

Uses item attributes (e.g., genre, keywords, description).

Example: Netflix suggesting movies based on genres you've watched.
Collaborative Filtering:


Recommends items based on user behavior and preferences.

Identifies patterns among users with similar tastes.

Example: Amazon suggesting products based on other users with similar purchase history.
Hybrid Recommendation System:

Combines content-based and collaborative filtering techniques.

Provides more accurate and personalized recommendations

Example: Spotify recommending music by analyzing listening history and user similarities.
Knowledge-Based Recommendations:

Uses explicit user preferences and constraints to recommend items.

Example: Travel websites suggesting destinations based on budget and interests.

Deep Learning-Based Recommendations:

Uses neural networks and deep learning techniques to model complex user-item interactions.

Example: YouTubeâ€™s personalized video recommendations.
